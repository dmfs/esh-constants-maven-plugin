# ESH Constants Generator Maven Plugin

## What?

This plugin generates a Java constants class with all namings definded in the `ESH_INF` folder.

## Why?

Because it's hard to write this class on your own, if you have a lot of content. Also, the XML files should be
in the lead and your code base is in sync all the time.
